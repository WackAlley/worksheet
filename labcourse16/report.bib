title = {Time evolution of cascade decay},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We study non-perturbatively the time evolution of cascade decay for generic fields  and obtain the time dependence of amplitudes and populations for the resonant and final states. We analyze in detail the different time scales and the manifestation of unitary time evolution in the dynamics of production and decay of resonant intermediate and final states. The probability of occupation (population) ‘flows’ as a function of time from the initial to the final states. When the decay width of the parent particle  is much larger than that of the intermediate resonant state  there is a ‘bottleneck’ in the flow, the population of resonant states builds up to a maximum at  nearly saturating unitarity and decays to the final state on the longer time scale . As a consequence of the wide separation of time scales in this case the cascade decay can be interpreted as evolving sequentially . In the opposite limit the population of resonances () does not build up substantially and the cascade decay proceeds almost directly from the initial parent to the final state without resulting in a large amplitude of the resonant state. An alternative but equivalent non-perturbative method useful in cosmology is presented. Possible phenomenological implications for heavy sterile neutrinos as resonant states and consequences of quantum entanglement and correlations in the final state are discussed.}

   title = {GeCo : A gamma-ray spectroscopy system for evaluation of coincidence methods in radionuclide monitoring},
   abstract = {Radionuclide monitoring is a proven means of non-intrusive verification of the nuclear test ban treaty. In addition to that, the potential use of radionuclide monitoring spans beyond the detection of nuclear test explosions, since radionuclides can also be released and detected from operations of nuclear fuel cycle facilities, such as the reactor operation and nuclear reprocessing of plutonium production. In this work, we consider the use of coincidence and anticoincidence techniques as a means to increase the sensitivity in radionuclide monitoring, in terms of improved minimum detectable amount for radionuclides of interest to filter stations used in radionuclide monitoring. In particular, a multi-detector setup is currently being prepared for the evaluation of the technique, and to provide validation data for a coincidence detector simulation codes. In this presentation, we will describe the multi-detector setup assembled for enabling the evaluation of various types of spectrometry, including 1) gamma-gamma coincidence (from dual detectors and up to five High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors), 2) anticoincidence using BGO active shield with single HPGe detector, as well as use of multiple detectors in add-back mode, i.e. simply using the combined detector volume for increased efficiency of single gamma rays. We will present the results of measurements of a calibration sample, and provide a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the tested techniques in the context of radionuclide monitoring. },
