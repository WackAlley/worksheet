In most practical circumstances, it is appropriate to
assume a Poisson distribution, which, if the number
of counts is large, can be approximated by a Normal
(Gaussian) distribution.

A modern digital gamma-ray spectrum is in essence a
list of numbers of pulses measured within small consec-
utive pulse height ranges. Detector calibration allows the
gamma-ray spectrum to be interpreted in terms of energy,
rather than channel number or voltage, and amount of
radionuclide, rather than number of pulses. In addition,
especially if computer analysis of the spectrum is contem-
plated, it may be necessary to provide information about
the peak width variation with energy or channel number.

This change in primary electron energy, which
is called the field increment effect, will be reflected in
the number of electronâ€“hole pairs produced
